##### Purpose

> To create a web application and learn how public APIs work and how it can be integrated to the code.

# PlaygroundAPI

PlaygroundAPI is focus on retrieving informations from public APIs and display them accordingly to the user.

## About

-	Web Application that uses Express.js and Node.js to handle the data along with other dependencies.
-	Includes a form in the front-end to allow the users retrieve their desired information.
-	Uses Embedded JavaScript Templating [https://ejs.co/](https://ejs.co/) to organize the parts into components.
-	Hosted on AWS with Elastic Beanstalk.

## APIs Usage

- [Twilio's API](https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/api) : Send SMS messaging to phones. On FREE trial, so only to my phone. Send me a text message :)
- [Foursquare's API](https://foursquare.com/developers/explore) : Find a place to eat, relax, or anything else based on a location.
- [Bitcoin Avarage's API](https://apiv2.bitcoinaverage.com/convert/global) : Convert Cryptocurrency (BTC, etc) into Fiat currency (USD, etc).
- [OpenweatherMap's API](https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather) : Enter a city and it will display current weather.

## Web Technologies

Express.js, Node.js, RESTful APIs, Embedded JavaScript Templating, Body-Parser, Request, Lodash.

## What can it be use for?
For other developers having problems on connecting with third party APIs, this repository includes code snippets as a reference on how I developed the code.

## In the future
Will include more services from more public APIs.
